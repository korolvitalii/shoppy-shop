## Architectural Principles

### Feature-First Structure

The application is organized around business features instead of technical file types.

For example, everything related to the shopping cart is located inside the `cart` feature.

This keeps features isolated and makes the project easier to scale.

### Standalone Components

The project uses standalone components, directives, and pipes.

This reduces unnecessary module configuration and simplifies lazy loading, testing, and dependency management.

### Smart and Presentational Components

Container components are responsible for:

* Retrieving state
* Dispatching actions
* Handling route parameters
* Coordinating business logic
* Communicating with facades

Presentational components are responsible for:

* Rendering data
* Receiving typed inputs
* Emitting user actions
* Remaining reusable and independent from application state

Example:

```text
catalogue-page.component
├── product-filter.component
├── product-sort.component
├── product-grid.component
│   └── product-card.component
└── pagination.component
```

### Facade Pattern

Components do not communicate directly with NgRx stores or HTTP services.

Each feature exposes a facade that provides a simple API for the UI layer.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class CartFacade {
  readonly items = this.store.selectSignal(selectCartItems);
  readonly total = this.store.selectSignal(selectCartTotal);
  readonly loading = this.store.selectSignal(selectCartLoading);

  constructor(private readonly store: Store) {}

  loadCart(): void {
    this.store.dispatch(CartActions.loadCart());
  }

  addProduct(productId: string): void {
    this.store.dispatch(CartActions.addProduct({ productId }));
  }

  removeProduct(productId: string): void {
    this.store.dispatch(CartActions.removeProduct({ productId }));
  }
}
```

Benefits:

* Components stay simple
* State implementation can change without rewriting UI components
* Business operations are easier to test
* Store selectors and actions are hidden from the presentation layer

### Repository Pattern

HTTP communication is isolated inside repository services.

```ts
export abstract class ProductRepository {
  abstract getProducts(
    query: ProductSearchQuery
  ): Observable<PaginatedResult<Product>>;

  abstract getProductById(id: string): Observable<Product>;

  abstract getRelatedProducts(id: string): Observable<Product[]>;
}
```

The concrete API implementation:

```ts
@Injectable()
export class ApiProductRepository implements ProductRepository {
  private readonly http = inject(HttpClient);

  getProducts(
    query: ProductSearchQuery
  ): Observable<PaginatedResult<Product>> {
    return this.http.get<PaginatedResult<Product>>('/api/products', {
      params: buildHttpParams(query),
    });
  }

  getProductById(id: string): Observable<Product> {
    return this.http.get<Product>(`/api/products/${id}`);
  }

  getRelatedProducts(id: string): Observable<Product[]> {
    return this.http.get<Product[]>(`/api/products/${id}/related`);
  }
}
```

This separation allows API implementations to be replaced with mocks, local storage, or another back end.

---

## State Management Strategy

The application uses different state-management tools depending on the type of state.

### Local Component State

Angular Signals are used for simple UI state:

* Open and closed menus
* Selected tabs
* Form visibility
* Loading indicators local to a component
* Selected images
* Temporary UI preferences

```ts
readonly selectedImageIndex = signal(0);
readonly isDescriptionExpanded = signal(false);
```

### Feature State

NgRx is used for complex shared feature state:

* Product catalogue
* Shopping cart
* Authentication
* Checkout
* Orders
* User profile
* Administration

### Server State

Data returned from the API is normalized and managed through feature stores.

The application avoids duplicating the same server data across multiple components.

### URL State

Search, filters, sorting, and pagination are stored in query parameters.

Example:

```text
/products?category=laptops&minPrice=500&sort=price-asc&page=2
```

This makes filtered views:

* Shareable
* Bookmarkable
* Restorable after refresh
* Compatible with browser navigation

---

## Reactive Programming

RxJS is used for asynchronous workflows and event composition.

Examples include:

* Debounced search
* Request cancellation
* Authentication refresh
* Route parameter handling
* Combining filters
* Loading related products
* Checkout workflows

Product search example:

```ts
readonly searchResults$ = this.searchControl.valueChanges.pipe(
  debounceTime(300),
  distinctUntilChanged(),
  switchMap((searchTerm) =>
    this.productRepository.searchProducts(searchTerm).pipe(
      catchError(() => of([]))
    )
  )
);
```

`switchMap` cancels the previous API request when the user enters a new search value.

---

## Routing

All major features are lazy loaded.

```ts
export const appRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    loadComponent: () =>
      import('./features/home/pages/home-page.component').then(
        (component) => component.HomePageComponent
      ),
  },
  {
    path: 'products',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./features/catalogue/catalogue.routes').then(
        (routes) => routes.CATALOGUE_ROUTES
      ),
  },
  {
    path: 'cart',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./features/cart/cart.routes').then(
        (routes) => routes.CART_ROUTES
      ),
  },
  {
    path: 'checkout',
    canActivate: [authenticationGuard],
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./features/checkout/checkout.routes').then(
        (routes) => routes.CHECKOUT_ROUTES
      ),
  },
  {
    path: 'admin',
    canMatch: [adminGuard],
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./features/administration/administration.routes').then(
        (routes) => routes.ADMINISTRATION_ROUTES
      ),
  },
];
```

Route guards are used for:

* Authentication
* Role-based access
* Unsaved checkout changes
* Administrative permissions

---

## API Communication

The application uses typed API contracts and centralized HTTP handling.

### HTTP Interceptors

Interceptors are responsible for:

* Adding access tokens
* Adding correlation identifiers
* Handling API errors
* Refreshing expired tokens
* Tracking request duration
* Retrying selected requests

```ts
export const authenticationInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (
  request,
  next
) => {
  const authService = inject(AuthenticationService);
  const token = authService.accessToken();

  const authenticatedRequest = token
    ? request.clone({
        setHeaders: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
        },
      })
    : request;

  return next(authenticatedRequest);
};
```

### Error Handling

API errors are transformed into application-specific error models.

```ts
export interface ApplicationError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  validationErrors?: Record<string, string[]>;
  correlationId?: string;
}
```

The application provides:

* Global error notifications
* Inline form validation
* Retry actions
* Dedicated error pages
* Logging with correlation IDs
* User-friendly messages

---

## Forms

The application uses strongly typed reactive forms.

```ts
interface ShippingAddressForm {
  firstName: FormControl<string>;
  lastName: FormControl<string>;
  street: FormControl<string>;
  city: FormControl<string>;
  postalCode: FormControl<string>;
  country: FormControl<string>;
}
```

Forms include:

* Reusable validators
* Async validation
* Cross-field validation
* Server validation errors
* Accessible error messages
* Disabled submission during requests
* Unsaved changes protection

---

## Performance Optimization

The project includes several performance-focused techniques:

* Lazy-loaded routes
* OnPush change detection
* Signals for efficient UI updates
* `trackBy` or Angular tracking expressions
* Deferred loading for non-critical content
* Image optimization
* Route-level code splitting
* Virtual scrolling for large lists
* Request cancellation
* Memoized selectors
* Cached API responses
* Prefetching important routes
* Skeleton loading
* Optimized production builds

Example:

```html
@for (product of products(); track product.id) {
  <app-product-card
    [product]="product"
    (addToCart)="addToCart($event)"
  />
}
```

Non-critical sections can be deferred:

```html
@defer (on viewport) {
  <app-related-products [productId]="productId()" />
} @placeholder {
  <app-product-grid-skeleton />
}
```

---

## Search Engine Optimization

The application can use server-side rendering or prerendering for public store pages.

SEO features include:

* Dynamic page titles
* Dynamic meta descriptions
* Canonical URLs
* Open Graph metadata
* Structured product data
* Semantic HTML
* Server-rendered product pages
* Sitemap generation
* Robots configuration

---

## Accessibility

The project follows accessibility best practices.

Implemented areas include:

* Semantic HTML
* Keyboard navigation
* Visible focus states
* Accessible forms
* Proper labels
* ARIA attributes where required
* Focus management in dialogs
* Accessible error messages
* Sufficient contrast
* Screen-reader-friendly navigation

---

## Security

The application demonstrates front-end security practices such as:

* Route protection
* Role-based authorization
* Token expiration handling
* Refresh-token flow
* Avoiding sensitive data in local storage
* Input validation
* Output escaping
* Content Security Policy compatibility
* Secure HTTP-only cookie support
* Prevention of open redirects
* Protection against duplicate submissions

Authorization is always treated as a back-end responsibility. Front-end guards improve user experience but are not considered a security boundary.

---

## Testing Strategy

```ts
test('user can add a product to the cart', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/products');

  await page
    .getByRole('article')
    .first()
    .getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to cart' })
    .click();

  await expect(page.getByTestId('cart-items-count')).toHaveText('1');
});
```

---

## Design System

Examples include:

* Buttons
* Inputs
* Selects
* Dialogs
* Product cards
* Price components
* Rating components
* Badges
* Notifications
* Skeletons
* Pagination
* Empty states
* Error states

Design tokens are used for:

* Colours
* Typography
* Spacing
* Border radius
* Breakpoints
* Shadows
* Animation duration

---

## Styling Architecture

SCSS follows a structured organization.

```text
styles/
├── abstracts/
│   ├── _variables.scss
│   ├── _mixins.scss
│   ├── _functions.scss
│   └── _breakpoints.scss
├── base/
│   ├── _reset.scss
│   ├── _typography.scss
│   └── _global.scss
├── layout/
├── themes/
└── styles.scss
```

Component styles remain encapsulated and avoid unnecessary global selectors.

The project uses:

* Responsive design
* Mobile-first styling
* CSS custom properties
* SCSS mixins
* Consistent spacing
* Reusable design tokens
* Dark and light themes

---

## Code Quality

The project follows strict development rules:

* Strict TypeScript configuration
* No implicit `any`
* Typed API responses
* Small and focused functions
* Single-responsibility classes
* Immutable state updates
* Dependency inversion
* Early returns
* Clear naming
* No business logic inside templates
* No direct store access from presentational components
* No duplicated API logic
* No magic strings or numbers

---

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility

Each component, service, facade, repository, and store has one clear responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle

Features are extended through abstractions and configuration instead of modifying unrelated existing code.

### Liskov Substitution

Repository implementations follow shared contracts and can be replaced without affecting consumers.

### Interface Segregation

Small feature-specific interfaces are preferred over large shared models.

### Dependency Inversion

Business logic depends on repository abstractions rather than concrete HTTP implementations.

---

## Patterns Used

* Facade Pattern
* Repository Pattern
* Smart and Presentational Components
* Adapter Pattern
* Strategy Pattern
* Builder Pattern
* Dependency Injection
* Unidirectional Data Flow
* Feature Slices
* Container and Presenter Pattern

---

## Environment Configuration

Environment-specific values are provided through configuration.

```ts
export interface ApplicationConfig {
  apiUrl: string;
  production: boolean;
  enableLogging: boolean;
  paymentProvider: string;
}
```

Secrets are never committed to the repository.

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions validates each pull request.

The pipeline includes:

```text
Install dependencies
        ↓
Lint
        ↓
Type check
        ↓
Unit tests
        ↓
Production build
        ↓
End-to-end tests
        ↓
Docker image build
        ↓
Deployment
```

Branch protection can require:

* Successful pipeline execution
* Code review approval
* No unresolved comments
* Updated tests
* Conventional commit messages

---

## Git Workflow

The project uses feature branches.

```text
main
develop
